Traffic control with deep Q learning and SUMO environment and Pytorch model \\
- Policy network takes inputs include information of SUMO map and a binary image which \\
represents vehicle positions return from the environment.
- Implement relay memory with NamedTuple, deque in Python and TensorDict (Pytorch) \\
